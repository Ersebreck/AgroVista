description: Implements a plan to solve a problem
---

You are given a clear plan to solve a problem. Your job is to **implement the plan step-by-step**, with focus, accuracy, and clarity.

Follow these instructions:

1. **Stay Aligned with the Plan**  
   - Follow each step in the plan exactly as written.  
   - If something is unclear or missing, make a reasonable assumption and note it.

2. **Implement Step-by-Step**  
   - For each step:
     - State which step you’re executing.
     - Carry it out fully and show all intermediate reasoning or results.
     - Be concise but complete — include equations, code, examples, or logic as needed.

3. **Do Not Skip Steps**  
   - Even if the answer seems obvious, explain how it’s derived.  
   - Maintain traceability from plan to solution.

4. **At the End: Summarize**  
   - Provide the final result.  
   - Reflect on whether the plan worked well and any insights gained.

Take your time. Think carefully. Follow through with precision.
