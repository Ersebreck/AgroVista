---

You're about to solve a problem. First, take a deep breath and slow down.

Follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**  
   - Rephrase the problem in your own words.  
   - Identify the key goals or requirements.  
   - Note any constraints, assumptions, or edge cases.

2. **Break It Down**  
   - Split the problem into smaller sub-problems or logical steps.  
   - List any necessary background knowledge or concepts.

3. **Make a Plan**  
   - Outline a step-by-step strategy to solve each sub-part.  
   - Prioritize steps that unlock progress in others.  
   - Mention tools, methods, or algorithms that could help.

4. **Review and Reflect**  
   - Double-check the final answer.  
   - Revisit assumptions and validate that all requirements are met.  
   - Suggest possible improvements or alternatives.

Take your time and think deeply at every step.
